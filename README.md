# olive-oil-classification
This is a mini ML and DL Project where we we work on olive oil dataset and apply ML classifiers like : 
* [Na√Øve Bayesian](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html)
* [Nearest Neighbors (-NN)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#nearest-neighbors)
* [Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/lda_qda.html)
* [Decision Tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree)
* [Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/neural_networks/plot_mlp_training_curves.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-neural-networks-plot-mlp-training-curves-py)
* [Support Vector Machine (SVM)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#support-vector-machines)

## About the Dataset
[The dataset](https://www2.chemie.uni-erlangen.de/publications/ANN-book/datasets/oliveoil/index.html) contains the percentage composition of **eight fatty acids** found by lipid fraction of **572** Italian olive oils. The data come from three areas; within each area there are a number of constituent regions, of which there are **9** in total.
